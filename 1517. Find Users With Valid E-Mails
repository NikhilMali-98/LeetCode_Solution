/* 
REGEXP_LIKE (source_string, pattern [, match_parameter])
source_string: The string or column to be searched.
pattern: The regular expression pattern you want to match.
match_parameter: Optional, defines matching behavior, like case sensitivity.
Explanation of Parameters:
source_string: This is the string you want to evaluate, such as a column in a table or a literal string.

pattern: A regular expression defining the search pattern. For example:

^ matches the beginning of the string.
$ matches the end of the string.
. matches any character except a newline.
[abc] matches any one of the characters a, b, or c.
* matches 0 or more occurrences of the preceding element.
+ matches 1 or more occurrences of the preceding element.
match_parameter: Optional flags to control behavior:

'i': Case-insensitive matching..
'c': Case-sensitive matching (default).
'n': Allows a period (.) to match a newline character.


Example Usage:

1. Simple Pattern Matching
Find names that start with "A" (case-insensitive):

SELECT name 
FROM Employees 
WHERE REGEXP_LIKE(name, '^A', 'i');
This will return all names starting with "A" or "a".

2. Matching Digits
To find strings that contain exactly 5 digits:

SELECT phone_number 
FROM Contacts 
WHERE REGEXP_LIKE(phone_number, '^[0-9]{5}$');
This checks if the phone number has exactly 5 digits.

3. Email Validation
To validate email addresses:

SELECT email 
FROM Users 
WHERE REGEXP_LIKE(email, '^[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]{2,}$');

This pattern checks for a valid email format with a username, "@" symbol, domain name, and a valid top-level domain.
Key Points to Remember:
Pattern Anchors:

^ matches the start of a string.
$ matches the end of a string.
Quantifiers:

* (0 or more times),
+ (1 or more times),
{n} (exactly n times),
{n,m} (between n and m times).
Special Characters:

Escape special characters like ., *, and + with a backslash (\) if you want to match them literally.
Character Classes:

[a-z]: Matches any lowercase letter.
[0-9]: Matches any digit.
\d: Matches any digit (shortcut).
